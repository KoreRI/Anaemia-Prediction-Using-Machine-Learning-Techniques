# Anaemia-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
•	Prediction of Anaemia Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Diagnosis

# Objective:

•	Developed a machine learning model for predicting anaemia based on patient data, including clinical, demographic, and laboratory features, to aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

# Key Achievements:

•	Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including KNN, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression for predicting anaemia risk.

•	Conducted feature engineering and data preprocessing (e.g., missing value imputation, scaling, encoding categorical variables) to optimize model performance.

	
# Technologies & Tools: 

•	Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks.
